To perform image compression, apply SVD on each matrix and get rid of the small singular values to compress the image. The loss of information through this process is negligible, and the difference between the images can be hardly spotted.\n",

    "[Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (PCA) is another dimensionality reduction technique that reduces dimensions or features while still preserving the maximum (or close-to) amount of information. This is useful when analyzing large datasets that contain a high number of dimensions or features that may be correlated. PCA aims to eliminate features that are highly correlated and only retain the important/uncorrelated ones that can describe most or all the variance in the data. This enables better interpretability and visualization of the multi-dimensional data. In this problem, we will investigate how PCA can be used to improve features for regression and classification tasks and how the data itself affects the behavior of PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for PCA. In PCA, we first center the data by subtracting the mean of each feature. SVD is well suited for this task since each singular value tells us the amount of variance captured in each component for a given matrix (e.g. image). Hence, we can use SVD to extract data only in directions with high variances using either a threshold of the amount of variance or the number of bases/components. Here, we will reduce the data to a set number of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from class that in PCA, we project the original matrix $X$ into new components, each one corresponding to an eigenvector of the covariance matrix $X^T X$. We know that SVD decomposes X into three matrices U, S, and V^T. We can find the SVD decomposition of X^T\\*X using the decomposition for X as follows:\n",
    "$$X^TX = (USV^T)^TUSV^T = (VS^TU^T)USV^T = V S^2 V^T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means two important things for us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The matrix $V^T$, often referred to as the _right singular vectors_ of $X$, is equivalent to the _eigenvectors_ of $X^TX$.\n",
    "- $S^2$ is equivalent to the _eigenvalues_ of $X^TX$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first $n$-principal components are obtained by projecting $X$ by the first $n$ vectors from $V^T$. Similarly, $S^2$ gives a measure of the variance retained.\n",

    "Feature selection is an integral aspect of machine learning. It is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features that are to be used as the input for the machine learning task. Feature selection may lead to simpler models for easier interpretation, shorter training times, avoidance of the curse of dimensionality, and better generalization by reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the <strong>feature_reduction.py</strong> file, complete the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>forward_selection</strong>\n",
    "- <strong>backward_elimination</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions should each output a list of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "In forward selection, we start with a null model, start fitting the model with one individual feature at a time, and select the feature with the minimum p-value. We continue to do this until we have a set of features where one feature's p-value is less than the confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to implement it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a significance level (given to you).\n",
    "2. Fit all possible simple regression models by considering one feature at a time.\n",
    "3. Select the feature with the lowest p-value.\n",
    "4. Fit all possible models with one extra feature added to the previously selected feature(s).\n",
    "5. Select the feature with the minimum p-value again. if p_value < significance, go to Step 4. Otherwise, terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backward Elimination:\n",
    "\n",
    "In backward elimination, we start with a full model, and then remove the insignificant feature with the highest p-value (that is greater than the significance level). We continue to do this until we have a final set of significant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to implement it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a significance level (given to you).\n",
    "2. Fit a full model including all the features.\n",
    "3. Select the feature with the highest p-value. If (p-value > significance level), go to Step 4, otherwise terminate.\n",
    "4. Remove the feature under consideration.\n",
    "5. Fit a model without this feature. Repeat entire process from Step 3 onwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT 1:** The p-value is known as the observed significance value for a null hypothesis. In our case, the p-value of a feature is associated with the hypothesis $H_{0}\\colon \\beta_j = 0$. If $\\beta_j = 0$, then this feature contributes no predictive power to our model and should be dropped. We reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is smaller than our significance level. More briefly, a p-value is a measure of how much the given feature significantly represents an observed change. A lower p-value represents higher significance. Some more information about p-values can be found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-p-value-b9e6c207247f\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT 2:** For this function, you will have to install statsmodels if not installed already. To do this, run `pip install statsmodels` in command line/terminal. In the case that you are using an Anaconda environment, run `conda install -c conda-forge statsmodels` in the command line/terminal. For more information about installation, refer to https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/install.html. The statsmodels library is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. You will have to use this library to choose a regression model to fit your data against. Some more information about this module can be found here: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT 3:** For step 2 in each of the forward and backward selection functions, you can use the `sm.OLS` function as your regression model. Also, do not forget to add a bias to your regression model. A function that may help you is the `sm.add_constants` function.\n",

    "We are given a dataset of user-movie ratings ($R$) that looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./data/svd_recommender_matrix.png\" height=\"200\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratings in the matrix range from 1-5. In addition, the matrix contains `nan` wherever there is no rating provided by the user for the corresponding movie. One simple way to utilize this matrix to predict movie ratings for a given user-movie pair would be to fill in each row / column with the average rating for that row / column.\n",
    "For example: For each movie, if any rating is missing, we could just fill in the average value of all available ratings and expect this to be around the actual / expected rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this may sound like a good approximation, it turns out that by just using SVD we can improve the accuracy of the predicted rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How does SVD fit into this picture?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall how we previously used SVD to compress images by throwing out less important information. We could apply the same idea to our above matrix ($R$) to generate another matrix ($R\\_$) which will provide the same information, i.e ratings for any user-movie pairs but by combining only the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that decomposition of matrix $R$ looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R = U\\Sigma V^{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can re-write this decomposition as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R = U\\sqrt\\Sigma \\sqrt\\Sigma V^{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to take only the top K singular values from this matrix, we could again write this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R\\_ = U\\sqrt\\Sigma_k \\sqrt\\Sigma_k V^{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we have now effectively separated our ratings matrix $R$ into two matrices given by:\n",
    "$\n",
    "U_k = U_{[:k]}\\sqrt\\Sigma_k\n",
    "$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$\n",
    "V_k = \\sqrt\\Sigma_k V_{[:k]}^{T}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to visualize the importance of $U$ and $V$ matrices but with respect to our context of movie ratings, we can visualize these matrices as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./data/svd_recommender_decomposition_matrix.png\" height=\"400\" width=\"700\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine each row of $U_k$ to be holding some information how much each user likes a particular feature (feature1, feature2, feature 3...feature $k$). On the contrary, we can imagine each column of $V_k^{T}$ to be holding some information about how much each movie relates to the given features (feature 1, feature 2, feature 3 ... feature $k$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets denote the row of $U_k$ by $u_i$ and the column of $V_k^{T}$ by $m_j$. Then the dot-product: $u_i \\cdot m_j$ can provide us with information on how much a user _i_ likes movie _j_.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What have we achieved by doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with a matrix $R$ containing very few ratings, we have been able to summarize the sparse matrix of ratings into matrices $U_k$ and $V_k$ which each contain feature vectors about the Users and the Movies. Since these feature vectors are summarized from only the most important K features (by our SVD), we can predict any User-Movie rating that is closer to the actual value than just taking any average rating of a row / column (recall our brute force solution discussed above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this method in practice is still not close to the state-of-the-art but for a naive and simple method we have used, we can still build some powerful visualizations as we will see in part 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have divided the task into 3 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement `recommender_svd` to return matrices $U_k$ and $V_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement `predict` to predict top 3 movies a given user would watch\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _(Ungraded)_ Feel free to run the final cell labeled to see some visualizations of the feature vectors you have generated\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Movie IDs are IDs assigned to the movies in the dataset and can be greater than the number of movies. This is why we have given movies_index and users_index as well that map between the movie IDs and the indices in the ratings matrix. Please make sure to use this as well.\n"
